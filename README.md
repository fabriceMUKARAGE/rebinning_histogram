# rebinning_histogram

This code provides a function to perform rebinning on a histogram. The rebinning can be done either by specifying new bin edges or by using relative or absolute tolerance. The rebinned histogram is returned as the result.

# Usage
import numpy as np
import hist
from hist import Hist

def rebin(histogram, new_bins=None, reltol=None, abstol=None):
    # Function implementation

def test_rebin():
    # Function to test the rebin function
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rebin function takes the following parameters:

histogram: The input histogram to be rebinned.
new_bins (optional): A list of new bin edges for each axis. If provided, the histogram will be rebinned using these new bin edges.
reltol (optional): The relative tolerance for rebinning. If provided, the histogram will be rebinned based on this relative tolerance.
abstol (optional): The absolute tolerance for rebinning. If provided, the histogram will be rebinned based on this absolute tolerance.
The function returns the rebinned histogram.

The test_rebin function is provided to test the rebin function with different test cases. It verifies the correctness of the rebinned histograms by comparing the bin edges, shape, and sum of values with the expected values.

# Example Usage
h = Hist(hist.axis.Regular(5, -5, 5))
rebinned_hist = rebin(h, new_bins=[[-7, -5, 0, 1]], reltol=0.1, abstol=None)

In this example, a histogram h with 5 bins ranging from -5 to 5 is created. The rebin function is called with new bin edges specified as [-7, -5, 0, 1] and a relative tolerance of 0.1. The resulting rebinned histogram is stored in rebinned_hist.

or
h = Hist(hist.axis.Regular(5, -5, 5))
rebinned_hist = rebin(h, new_bins=[[2,3], [1,2,3], [4,5]], reltol=0.001, abstol=0.001)

# Test Cases
The test_rebin function provides several test cases to validate the rebin function's behavior with different configurations of new bin edges, relative tolerance, and absolute tolerance. Each test case checks the correctness of the rebinned histogram by comparing the bin edges, shape, and sum of values with the expected values.

I'm sure there may be better approach, and I'd appreciate any suggestions for improvements.
